### Hi there I am Greta ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at [Cervest](https://github.com/cervest), most of my work happens in private repositories.  
- ðŸŒ± In my spare time I collaborate in an Art History project at [UNED](https://dimh.hypotheses.org/equipo).
  - CARCEM: Studying the cartographies of the city in the Modern Age is an invitation to pose new research questions centred on the spatial dimension. We work from a polyhedral viewpoint, which involves the different ways of conceiving, devising and projecting urban spaces using how they are described, narrated and represented, and how cities are used, passed through and inhabited.
  - I support the team in the design of the GIS database and development of webapps using the ESRI stack ([repo](https://github.com/gretacv/carcem_arcgis)) 
- ðŸ¦” In the past, I worked on the development of The Half-Earth Project.
- ðŸš² I like to visualise data using R and if possible creating shiny apps.
