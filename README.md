### Hi there I am Greta 👋

## 🔭 Now
### 👩‍💻 Work
I’m currently working at [Cervest](https://github.com/cervest), most of my work happens in private repositories.  

### 🌱 Spare time
In my spare time I collaborate in an Art History project at [UNED](https://dimh.hypotheses.org/equipo).
#### 🗺 CARCEM: 
Studying the cartographies of the city in the Modern Age is an invitation to pose new research questions centred on the spatial dimension. We work from a polyhedral viewpoint, which involves the different ways of conceiving, devising and projecting urban spaces using how they are described, narrated and represented, and how cities are used, passed through and inhabited.

I support the team in the design of the GIS database and development of webapps using the ESRI stack ([repo](https://github.com/carcem/carcem_arcgis)) 

## 🚀 How I got here
### 🦔 Work
In the past, I worked on the development of The Half-Earth Project at [Vizzuality](https://github.com/Vizzuality).
### 🚲 Motivation
I like to visualise data using R and if possible creating shiny apps or anything a bit more interactive. I did field work in Antarctica, the Amazon and the Gabonese rainforest, amazing ecosystems, but I think my natural habitat is in front of a computer crunching data, finding out if there is questions that can be answered with it.
